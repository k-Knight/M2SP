## Magicka 2 Spellcasting Practice
    The purpose of this project is to aid one's spellcasting skills in a game called "Magicka 2".
## Method of skill improvement
    As a method of skill improvement the repetative spellcasting is used. That is, the user is asked to input specific spell into the application, then, after the user presses spacebar, backspace or enter buttons, the spell of the user gets checked and the result is being displayed by the application.
## Additional features
    Furthermore, this application provides a "magicks" cheat sheet, so that a user can look up corresponding spells, as well as a statistics form, where user can witness his/her spellcasting statistics.
